# False Fact

Web extension that does a fact check of the website (meant for news articles)

## Install

To install you can use the zip file (and unzip it), then sideload in chrome extensions menu, enable developer mode, and load from unpacked

For firefox, you can test it as a "Temporary Add-on" in about:debugging, select the manifest file.

## Availability status

I'm publishing now

## contributions

PRs welcome, you can work on whatever, or there is also a [todo list](TODO.md)
Also file issues if you have a suggestion or issue of course

different kind of contribution: the [backend](https://github.com/tranquil-tr0/false-fact-server) can't do high load because I don't have the money for that, you're free to help support or give suggestions for that too
