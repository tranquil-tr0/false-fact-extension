Web extension that does a fact check of the website (meant for news articles)

To install you can use the zip file (and unzip it), then sideload in chrome extensions menu, enable developer mode, and load from unpacked

For firefox, you can test it as a "Temporary Add-on" in about:debugging, select the manifest file.
