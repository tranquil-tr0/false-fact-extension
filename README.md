Web extension that does a fact check of the website (meant for news articles)

To install you can use the zip file, then sideload in chrome extensions menu, enable developer mode, and load from unpacked, or use the crx, however that's done (I don't remember)

I'll build for firefox soon! (assuming no big issues)
